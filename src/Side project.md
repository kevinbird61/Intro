### ★ Network-related Projects

#### [P4 researching](https://github.com/kevinbird61/p4-researching) 

![](res/program_architecture.png)

P4 learning and experiment materials. Also make some tutorials/training courses and test
environment (via Docker) of P4.

Provide some implementation of P4 in open source environment (`BMv2`):
* Basic forwarding
* Dynamic forwarding 
* ECMP/WCMP
* L2 learning switch
* Digest (Feature of P4)
* MPLS (simplify version)
* NAT
* Monitor (leverage counter)
* Local routing (leverage register)
* Boardcast/Multicast

#### [Virtual Router](https://github.com/kevinbird61/virtual-router)

![](res/virtual-router-topo.png)

Using tuntap to simulate router port, and implement software router and related network functions with C, and also provide documents on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@scyu/HyGwpzGL8), support: 
* Basic forwarding
* L3
    * ARP
* L4
    * ICMP
* Simple CLI implementation
    * show command (e.g. show router's statistics)
    * debug command (e.g. show the information of forwarding packets)
